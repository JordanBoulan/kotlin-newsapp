# A simple news app in Kotlin
</br>
This app reads news articles from a json file stored in assets. However, this can easily be modified to pull from the web or a live news api.
</br>
Clicking on articles will open the web-browser and navigate to that story. There are stubs for activities to view images and videos in the app. I left them as stubs for now and focused on a fully-functioning main page where you can navigate to every story. You can view the images and videos by clicking the story.

This is a simple proof-of-concept that can be adapted for different purposes.
